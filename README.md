Redlining and bird biodiversity research project

Research looking at how land use, land use changes, and the historical uses of land (including racist policies leading to systemic disinvestment in areas) impact current biodiversity and community assemblages.

This project uses eBird data to look at the influence of land use patterns and other environmental patterns affect bird communities.
